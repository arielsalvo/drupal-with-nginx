### Upstream configuration for PHP FastCGI.

## Add as many servers as needed:
## Cf. http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpUpstreamModule.
## Note that this configuration assumes by default that keepalive
## upstream connections are supported and that you have a Nginx
## version with the fair load balancer.

## Add as many servers as needed. Cf. http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpUpstreamModule.
upstream phpcgi {
    ## Use the least connection algorithm for load balancing. This
    ## algorithm was introduced in versions 1.3.1 and 1.2.2.
    least_conn;

    server 127.0.0.1:9001;
    server 127.0.0.1:9002;
    ## Create a backend connection cache. Note that this requires
    ## Nginx version greater or equal to 1.1.4.
    ## Cf. http://nginx.org/en/CHANGES. Comment out the following
    ## line if that's not the case.
    keepalive 5;
}

## Add a third pool as a fallback. Note that this requires php-cgi
## side by side php-fpm. If you have it installed uncomment it.
#upstream phpcgi_backup {
    #server 127.0.0.1:9003;
    ## Create a backend connection cache. Note that this requires
    ## Nginx version greater or equal to 1.1.4.
    ## Cf. http://nginx.org/en/CHANGES. Comment out the
    ## following line if that's not the case.
    #keepalive 1;
#}

## The upstreams below are used only for monitoring php-fpm status,

## The PHP TCP upstream that corresponds to the first pool: www0.
upstream phpcgi_www0 {
    server 127.0.0.1:9001;
}

## The PHP TCP upstream that corresponds to the second pool: www1.
upstream phpcgi_www1 {
    server 127.0.0.1:9002;
}


### Configuration of php-fpm status and ping pages. Here we define the
### allowed hosts using the Geo Module. http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpGeoModule

geo $phpcgi_status_acl {
    default 1;
    127.0.0.1 0; # allow on the loopback
    10.0.0.0/8 0; # allow on an internal network
    192.168.1.0/24 0; # allow on an internal network
}
